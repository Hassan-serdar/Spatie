# Laravel Roles & Permissions Example (Using Spatie)

This is a small **educational project** built with Laravel to demonstrate how to implement **Roles and Permissions** using the [Spatie Laravel-Permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission) package.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The main goal of this project is to **learn and experiment** with user role and permission management in a Laravel application.  
It is not a complete or production-ready system â€” just a focused implementation of this specific feature.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Basic user authentication (Laravel Breeze)
- Role and permission setup using Spatie package
- Assigning roles to users
- Restricting access to routes based on roles or permissions

## ðŸš« Disclaimer

> This project is not a full application. It was built for educational purposes only to understand how role-based access control works in Laravel using the Spatie package.
